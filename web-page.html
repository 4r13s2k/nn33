		A thing about <z>gen-z</z> is that we are the most loved generation. Be it by our parents or some one else. So 		much so that we are pampered beyond any reasonable limits are do not know the real crux of 'living' 		anymore. Hence in our attempt to fall and understand life we live in a simulated world where things 		known to be pretty much out of control.

		Well so it would seem, the thing about games is that they are created by an individual (mostly an organization), which means he had all the reasons to entertain the user by letting him survive through the entire thing. To add more 'realism' today's games allow the user character mortality where in if he dies, he dies! Hmmmm, again not so much of a death as much a retry it seems. But hold yourselves, there are achievements which players run after like wild hounds. And these achivemets usually contain feats like "Stay Untouched" or "Zero Retries" which takes the player engagement to next level, becuase all of a sudden living is a mandatory thing to pursue again. All that "risk" to take from the comfort of home. A way to live I guess?
